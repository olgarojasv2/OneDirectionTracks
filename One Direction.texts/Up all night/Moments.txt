Moments

Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try

Heart beats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You’ll know I'll be

Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Close the door
Throw the key
Don’t wanna be reminded
Don’t wanna be seen
Don’t wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight’s sky

Hands are silent, voice's numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
You’ll know I'll be

Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today

Flashing lights in my mind
going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in y toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pie of my clothes at the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall, make a joke of it all

You know I'll be

Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
