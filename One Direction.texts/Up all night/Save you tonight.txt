Save you tonight

I, I wanna save your, wanna save your heart tonight
He’ll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh

It’s a quarter to 3
Can’t sleep at all
He’s so overrated
If you told me to jump
I’d take the fall, and he wouldn’t take it
All that you want is under your nose
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed

I, I wanna save ya, wanna save your heart tonight
He’ll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can’t be no superman
But for you I’ll be superhuman
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya, tonight

Oh now you’re at home and he don’t call
Cause he don’t adore ya
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn ya
What you want what you need has been right here, yeah
I can see your holding back those tears, tears

I, I wanna save ya, wanna save your heart tonight
He’ll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can’t be no superman
But for you I’ll be superhuman
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya, tonight

Up, up and away ill take you with me
Up, up and away ill take you with me

I, I wanna save ya, wanna save your heart tonight
He’ll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can’t be no superman
But for you I’ll be superhuman
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya, tonight

I, I wanna save your, save ya, save ya, tonight
I, I wanna save your, save ya, save ya, tonight
I, I wanna save your, save ya, save ya, tonight
