Everything about you

You know I’ve always got your back girl
So, let me be the one you come running too, running too, r-r-running
I say this just a matter of fact girl, you just call my name
I’ll be coming through, coming through, I’m c-coming
On the other side of the world it don’t matter,
I’ll be there in two, I’ll be there in two, I’ll be there in two
I still feel it every time, it’s just something that you do, now ask me why I want to

It’s everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch ba-by, to the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there’s nothing I could point to
It’s everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It’s everything that you do, do, do
It’s everything about you

Guess I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see it but don’t realise that it's m-my lovin'
Theres something about your laugh that makes me wanna have to
There’s nothing funny so we laugh at n-n-nothin'
Every minute’s like the last so let’s just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that’s tic-tic-tickin'
I still feel it every time, it’s just something that you do
Now ask me why I want too

It’s everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch ba-by, to the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there’s nothing I could point to
It’s everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It’s everything that you do, do, do
It’s everything about you

And you have always been the only one I wanted and
I wanted you to know without you
I can’t face it
All we wanna have is fun
But they say were to young
Let them say what they want

It’s everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do ,do
From the way that we touch ba-by, to the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there’s nothing I could point to
It’s everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It’s everything that you do, do, do
It’s everything about you
