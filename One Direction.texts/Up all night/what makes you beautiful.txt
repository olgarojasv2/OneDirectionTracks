What makes you beautiful

You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the do-o-or
Don't need make up, to cover up
Being the way that you are is eno-o-ough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow, you don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see, you'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know-ow-ow, you don't know you're beautifu-u-ul
But that's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a so-o-ong
I don't know why, you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your e-e-eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow, you don't know you're beautiful If only you saw what I can see, you'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know-ow-ow, you don't know you're beautifu-u-ul
But that's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow, you don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see, you'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know-ow-ow, you don't know you're beautifu-u-ul
You don't know you're beautifu-u-ul, but that's what makes you beautiful
