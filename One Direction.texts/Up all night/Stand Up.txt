Stand Up

From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine, take you and make you mine

I would walk through the desert,
I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans, just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine

Uh uh uh oh uh so put your hands up
Uh uh uh oh uh 'cause it's a stand up
I won't be leaving
Until I've finished stealing
Every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

I know your hearts been broken, but don't you give up
I'll be there, I know it, to fix you with love
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried

Then I will steal us a car
and we will drive to the stars
I will give you the moon
Its the least I can do
If you give me a chance.

Uh uh uh oh uh so put your hands up
Uh uh uh oh uh 'cause it's a stand up

I'm a thief, I'm a thief
You can call me a thief
I'm a thief, I'm a thief
But you should know you part
I'm a thief, I'm a thief
I'm only here because you stole my heart

I'm a thief, I'm a thief
You can call me a thief
I'm a thief, I'm a thief
But you should know you part
I'm a thief, I'm a thief
I'm only here because you stole my heart
