Stole my heart

The light shines
It’s getting hot on my shoulders
I don’t mind this time it doesn’t matter
Cos your friends they look good
And you look better
Don’t you know all night
I’ve been waiting for a girl like you to come around

Under the lights tonight
You turned around and you stole my heart
With just one look
When I saw your face I fell in love
It took a minute girl to steal my heart…tonight
With just one look… girl
Been waiting for a girl like you

I’m weaker my words fall and they hit the ground
Oh life come on head don’t you fail me now
I start to say I think I love you but I make no sound
You know cos all my life I’ve been waiting
For a girl like you to come around

There is no other place that I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground I’ll put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
Cos there is so much that I wanna say
I wanna say…

With just one look… girl
Been waiting for a girl like you
Been waiting for a girl like you
