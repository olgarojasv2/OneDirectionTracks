They dont know about us

People say we shouldn’t be together
We’re too young to know about forever
But I say, they don’t know

What they’re talk, talk, talking about (talk, talk, talking about)
Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don’t wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you’re mine girl, oh

They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the “I love yous”
But I betcha if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

One touch and I was a believer
Every kiss gets a little sweeter
It’s getting better, keeps getting better all the time girl

They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the “I love yous”
But I betcha if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

They don’t know how special you are
They don’t know what you’ve done to my heart
They can say anything they want
Cause they don’t know us

They don’t know what we do best
Is between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell ‘em, I wanna tell the world that you’re mine girl

They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the “I love yous”
But I betcha if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life

Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the “I love yous”
But I betcha if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night
They don’t know I’ve waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they don’t know about, they don’t know about us

They don’t know about us
