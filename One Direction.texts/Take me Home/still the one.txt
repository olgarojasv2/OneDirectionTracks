Still the One

Hello, hello I know it’s been a while but baby
I got something that I really wanna let you know
Yeah, something that I wanna let you know

You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn’t blame you cause I know I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone

And yeah, now I’m back at your door
You’re looking at me unsure
I should’ve seen it before
You’re all I think about baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you’re still the one
You might have moved on, but girl you should know
That I know you’re still the one

I know I’m saying too much
But I won’t ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you’re still the one
I know you’re still the one

Hello, hello I’m really hoping you’ll forgive me
I keep talking, begging tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl just tell me what I wanna hear

I tried, I’m tired to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said, yeah
I can’t get it out of my head (yeah)

And now I’m back at your door
You’re looking at me unsure
I should’ve seen it before
You’re all I think about baby

I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you’re still the one
You might have moved on, but girl you should know
That I know you’re still the one

I know I’m saying too much
But I won’t ever give up
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you’re still the one

Hey, you, you’re still the one
Hey, you, you’re still the one
Hey, you, you’re still the one
Hey, you, you’re still the one

I know I’m saying too much (yeah)
But I won’t ever give up (come on)
I was so stupid for letting you go
But I know you’re still the one
I know you’re still the one
