Change my mind

The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone’s gone

Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

But baby if you say, you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
Cause I don’t wanna know while I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say, you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I’ll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh
We take photographs
There’s no music on
But we dance along

Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more
As I’m walking towards the door
I’m not sure

But baby if you say, you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
Cause I don’t wanna know while I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say, you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I’ll change my mind

Na na na na na…
Na na na na na...
I’ll change my mind
Na na na na na...
Na na na na na...

But baby if you say, you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind

But baby if you say, you want me to stay
I’ll change my mind
Cause I don’t wanna know while I’m walking away
If you’ll be mine
Won’t go, won’t go
So baby if you say, you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I’ll change my mind
