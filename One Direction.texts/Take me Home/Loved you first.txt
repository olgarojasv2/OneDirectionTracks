Loved you first

Girl it should be me driving to your house
Knocking on your door, kissing you on the mouth
Holding on your hand, dancing in the dark
Cause I was the only one that loved you from the start
Now when I see you with him it tears my world apart

Cause I’ve been waiting all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart’s been taken, and nothing could be worse
Baby I loved you first
Had my chances, could’ve been where he is standing
That’s what hurts the most, girl I came so close
But now you’ll never know
Baby I loved you first

Girl it should be me calling on your phone
Saying you’re the one and that I’ll never let you go
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes
But now when I see you with him my whole world falls apart

Cause I’ve been waiting all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart’s been taken, and nothing could be worse
Baby I loved you first
Had my chances, could’ve been where he is standing
That’s what hurts the most, girl I came so close
But now you’ll never know
Baby I loved you first

The first touch, the first kiss
First girl to make me feel like this
Heartbreak is killing me, I Ioved you first why can’t you see

I’ve been waiting all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart’s been taken, and nothing could be worse

Baby I loved you first
Had my chances, could’ve been where he is standing
That’s what hurts the most, girl I came so close
But now you’ll never know
Baby I loved you first

Baby I loved you first
Baby I loved you first
Oh yeah
Baby I loved you first
