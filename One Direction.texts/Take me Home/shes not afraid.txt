Shes not afraid

She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low
She's addicted to the feeling of letting go
Let it go
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home
Take her home

But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

Maybe she's just trying to test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth
What you're worth
Or maybe all her friends have told her don't get closer
He'll just break your heart
But either way she's teasing me and it's just so hard

Cause every time I tell her how I feel
She says it’s not real

She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She’s not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

What about all the things we say
Talking on the phone so late
I can't let her get away from me
Oooh

But when I say that I can't do it no more
She's back at my door

She’s not
She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of fallin' in love
She not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she’s so afraid of fa-fa-fallin' in love
Oooh

She’s not afraid
She’s not afraid
Ohhhhh
